# rent vs buy
Spreadsheet based on the NY Times Rent vs. Buy calculator


This spreadsheet reproduces the popular New York Times Rent Vs Buy Calculator
Major Differences between the two: The spreadsheet allows rent values to be entered directly, as opposed to the NY Times Calculator which calculates total rent costs that are close to the total costs of buying
The maintenance costs are split into maintenance and renovation costs so renovation costs can be used to increase the home basis
The NY Times calculator applies a hard-coded capital gains tax rate of 15%. The spreadsheet allows that value to be changed.
